Hi Sir,

I’m really sorry for missing the deadline for the messaging project — I submitted it a few hours late.

I completely take responsibility for that and understand if there’s a penalty, but I hope it can still be considered.

I’ve worked hard on this project and this is very unlike me
I wanted to express my deepest apologies
Thank you
